# Thanos and the Prometheus Operator

<!--
## Thanos

The `Prometheus` CRD has support for adding a Thanos sidecar to the Prometheus Pod.
There are a few other components, like the queriers and stores, which Thanos needs to be fully functional, that have to be deployed independently.
The [kube-prometheus](contrib/kube-prometheus/) project has some experimental starting points.
